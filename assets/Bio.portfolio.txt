Hi! I'm Joshua Obando, I'm currently a student at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was previously a full time student at Middlesex County College starting in 2017 majoring in Linguistics. I left school for a couple years, jumping from job to job but this year I decided to finally sit down and go back to school. Coding is something very new to me, but I became very interested in it this summer and I can hopefully beging my career in being a web developer!



I'm interested in many things, but my favourites are languages and history. I've always been interested in linguistics but I never realized how obsessed I became on learning languages until about 4 years ago. My goal is to learn at least 6 languages before I retire. My other hobbies include; photography, sightseeing, and video games.
